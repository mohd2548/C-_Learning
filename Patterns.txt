Step-by-Step Role
- Inner loop (for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++))
- This loop runs n times (here, 4 times).
- Each run corresponds to one column in the current row.
- So if n = 4, it ensures 4 numbers are printed per row.

- cout << num << " ";
- Prints the current value of num followed by a space.
- num is a counter that keeps track of the sequence of numbers across the entire grid.
- Example: first row prints 1 2 3 4, second row prints 5 6 7 8, etc.

- num++;
- Increments num by 1 after each print.
- This ensures the next column prints the next number in sequence.
- Without this line, every column in the row would print the same number.

Why this matters
- The outer loop controls rows.
- The inner loop (this part) controls columns.
- num ensures that instead of repeating row/column indices, you get a continuous sequence of numbers across the entire matrix.



Dry run for trinagle pattern 

Code: 
int n = 6;
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
    for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++){
        cout << "*";
    }
    cout << endl;
}

dry run :

Dry run for the the Pattern 
A B C
D E F
G H I

code: 
int n = 3;
char ch = 'A';
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
        cout << ch;
        ch++;
    }
    cout << endl;
}
