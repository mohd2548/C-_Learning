Variable   ::  Conatainer whcih stores the data 

age = 25 
grade = 'A'   single quote  for character 
Name = "Sahil"  


Here are the Primitive Data types 

int data type take 4 bytes spaces in a memory 
1 digit is bit 
8 bits = 1 byte
eg : 01010101  = 1 byte
4 byte = 32 bits  spaces 

we can check the siz  of bytes  
by using ==>>  sizeof(age)





Char data type 
we store single character  
takes the spaces in memory that is  of 1 byte




Float data type 
It also accupy the 4 bytes of space in memory 

when we write float value always write f or F at the end of the value 
because compiler understand it as double if we dont write 

float PI = 3.147; acc to compilor " double"
float PI = 3.147f;

Boolean Data type 
1byte  memory 
val either true or False 

when we will print the bool value always give the out 
in the binary form like o and 1 
1 for True value
0 for False value


Double  
8 bytes memory
here also we store the decimal values
